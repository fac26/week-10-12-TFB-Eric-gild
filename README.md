# HOPE THE APP


We have created an app called Hope. It puts those in need of food directly in touch with retailers that find themselves with excess stock at the end of the day. We are building Hope as our Tech for Better Project for [Founders & Coders FAC26](https://github.com/fac26).

# PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

## Introduction

<details>

#### What are you building?

A web app to put those in need of food directly in touch with retailers that find themselves with excess stock at the end of the day.

#### Why are you building it?

We are building it because there is a cost of living crisis and more and more find themselves unable to buy food while the amount of food waste generated by the take away food industry continues to grow.

</details>

## Project Scope

<details>

#### What are you not building?

We are not building a React Native app nor are we building a delivery/ geolocation app. 

#### How did you decide what features were important?

We consulted the Product Owner and then during sprint planning creating issues pulled from two main and essential user stories.

</details>

## Project plan

<details>

#### How are you going to structure your sprints?

First week we decided to target completing one user story. That story being the vendor user story. The second week we are targeting the users user story and any stretch goals that we find ourselves having time to incorporate. We tracked our progress using the kanban board and issue estimation.

#### What order are you going to build in?

Our tech stack includes:

- React
- Next.js
- Supabase for authentication
- Airtable (for database)
- Cypress for testing

#### How did user research inform your plan?

We conducted user research and usability testing. Our users gave us valuable feedback which helped us refine our initial concept. In some instances that meant intergrating new features which we hadn't considered before and in other instances removing features that we had initialy thought essential. 

</details>

## Requirement analysis

<details>

#### How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?

We will ensure our project is accessible to as many users as possible by:

- ensuring our app is responsive
- using lighthouse feature to check accessibility
- using a colour contrast checker to ensure our colour scheme is accessible
- using semantic HTML to ensure our app is accessible to screen readers

#### Are there any legal or regulatory requirements you should consider?

Safe and secure storage of data ie. GDPR.

</details>

## Project learnings

<details>

#### Did your team work effectively?

Clear communication when creating the Kanban board made us more effective at meeting tasks and completing them, timeboxing tasks enabled us to laser focus and not fall down rabbit holes, pair programming meant we could rely on one another when hitting challenges.      

#### What would you do differently next time?

Ask for help earlier rather then struggle by ourselves and make best use of mentors and Discord help and soloutions channel. Read documentation more thourougly before starting work rather than being put off by it's dense and sometimes messy nature.   

</details>

## Research and findings

<details>

#### What did you find out from user testing?

We learned that:

- the colour palette was not good for colour blind users.
- Some of our icons in the navbar were not clear.
- Categorizing food items would be helpful if there are loads of food items for both vendor and user
- An incentive system is required to ensure that reserved food items are picked up, such as limiting reservations to three items or penalties.
- It is suggested to include a profile page to see my reservations / cancel reservations and a basket icon for reservation and vendor information.
- The picture on the front page should be changed to focus more on sharing/giving food instead of a delivery app.
- The app should emphasize "stigma-free" and offer an alternative to "ready for food?"
- Verification and confidentiality messages should be included for users who feel embarrassed asking for food.
- "Support us" rather than “Donate Now” would feel better.

<details>

#### Were your assumptions right or wrong?

</details>

## Recommendations and conclusions

<details>

#### What features would you prioritise to build next?

#### Was the project a success?

</details>

## Software Development Lifecycle stages

### Planning

<details>

#### What roles did your team take on?

`Explain the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project (K2)`

#### Did these roles help your team work effectively?

`Outline how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately (K6) Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution (K6)`

</details>

### Analysis

<details>

#### What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?

</details>

### Design

<details>

#### How did you plan a user experience?

#### What technical decisions did you make?

#### Server-render vs client-render vs both

#### Relational or non-relational or no DB

#### Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service

#### Frontend first vs DB first

#### Did you create a technical specification?

`Review methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and apply a justified approach to software development (K11, S11, S12)`

</details>

### Implementation/Build

<details>

#### How did you ensure your code was good?

`Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)`

#### What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?

`Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)`

#### How did you debug issues that arose?

`Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)`

</details>

### Test

#### How did you verify your project worked correctly?

- We used Cypress end-to-end testing to verify that our project functions correctly.



#### Did writing automated tests catch any bugs?



</details>

### Deploy

<details>

#### Where/how did you deploy your application?

`Review and justify their contribution to building, managing and deploying code into the relevant environment in accordance with the project specification (S10)`

#### What problems did you encounter during deployment?

</details>

### Maintain

<details>

#### Is it easy for someone make changes to the codebase?

#### Could a new person quickly be onboarded to contribute?
