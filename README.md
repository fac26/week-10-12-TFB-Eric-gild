## Introduction

<details>

#### What are you building?

A web app that ...

#### Why are you building it?

We are building it...

## Project Scope

<details>

#### What are you not building?

We are not building a React Native app...

#### How did you decide what features were important?

We conducted user research and usability testing. Our users gave us valuable feedback which helped us refine our initial concept. In some instances that meant intergrating new features which we hadn't considered before and in other instances removing features that we had initialy thought essential.

</details>

## Project plan

<details>

#### How are you going to structure your sprints?

Based on user research from Design Week we created the user stories. We then created a Kanban board on GitHub to track our progress. We used the Kanban board to create a sprint plan for each week of the project. For our first sprint we...

#### What order are you going to build in?

Our tech stack includes:

- React
- Next.js
- Supabase for authentication (& database)
- Cypress for testing
- Airtable (for database)

#### How did user research inform your plan?

## Requirement analysis

<details>

#### How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?

We will ensure our project is accessible to as many users as possible by:

- ensuring our app is responsive
- using lighthouse feature to check accessibility
- using a colour contrast checker to ensure our colour scheme is accessible
- using semantic HTML to ensure our app is accessible to screen readers

#### Are there any legal or regulatory requirements you should consider?

</details>

## Project learnings

<details>

#### Did your team work effectively?

Clear communication when creating Kanban board made us more effective at meeting tasks and completing them, timeboxing tasks enabled us to laser focus and not fall down rabbit holes, pair programming ment we could rely on one another when hitting challenges.      

#### What would you do differently next time?

Ask for help earlier rather then struggle by ourselves and make best use of mentors and help and soloutions. Read documentation more thourougly before starting work rather than being put off by it's dense and sometimes messy nature.

## Software Development Lifecycle stages

### Planning

<details>

#### What roles did your team take on?

`Explain the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project (K2)`

#### Did these roles help your team work effectively?

`Outline how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately (K6) Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution (K6)`

</details>

### Analysis

<details>

#### What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?

</details>

### Design

<details>

#### How did you plan a user experience?

#### What technical decisions did you make?

#### Server-render vs client-render vs both

#### Relational or non-relational or no DB

#### Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service

#### Frontend first vs DB first

#### Did you create a technical specification?

`Review methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and apply a justified approach to software development (K11, S11, S12)`

</details>

### Implementation/Build

<details>

#### How did you ensure your code was good?

`Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)`

#### What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?

`Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)`

#### How did you debug issues that arose?

`Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)`

</details>

### Test

#### How did you verify your project worked correctly?

- We used Cypress end-to-end testing to verify that our project functions correctly.



#### Did writing automated tests catch any bugs?



</details>

### Deploy

<details>

#### Where/how did you deploy your application?

`Review and justify their contribution to building, managing and deploying code into the relevant environment in accordance with the project specification (S10)`

#### What problems did you encounter during deployment?

</details>

### Maintain

<details>
